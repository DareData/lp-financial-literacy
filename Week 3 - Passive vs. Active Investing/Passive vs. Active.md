# Week 3: Passive vs. Active Investing

When it comes to investing, two distinct approaches dominate the conversation: **Passive Investing** and **Active Investing**. Both methods aim to grow wealth but differ significantly in their strategies, costs, and risks. Understanding these approaches will help you choose the one that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and available time.

##  1. What is Passive Investing?
Passive investing is all about simplicity and consistency. Instead of trying to "beat the market," passive investors aim to match the market’s performance by investing in broad market indexes, such as the S&P 500 or MSCI World Index - through ETFs or Low-Cost Funds.

Key Features:

* **Low Cost:** Since it involves minimal trading and management, passive investing usually has lower fees.
* **Diversification:** Index funds or ETFs often include hundreds or thousands of securities, spreading out risk.
* **Time-Efficient:** Once set up, a passive portfolio requires little day-to-day attention.
* **Long-Term Focus:** The goal is to ride out market fluctuations and benefit from the general upward trend of markets over time.

Example: Investing in an S&P 500 Index ETF
If you buy an S&P 500 ETF, you’re investing in 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. without picking individual stocks. Over the past 30 years, the average annual return of the S&P 500 has been about 10% (before inflation).

## 2. What is Active Investing?

Active investing involves managing your portfolio closely to outperform the market. Active investors analyze market trends, study financial reports, and make frequent trades to capitalize on short-term opportunities.

Key Features:
Potential for Higher Returns: With the right strategy and skill, active investing may generate higher returns than the market average. But, keep in mind that this has a very low probability.
More Involvement: It requires regular monitoring, research, and decision-making - leading to decision fatigue and poor decisions.
Higher Costs: Frequent trades and professional fund management result in higher fees and taxes.
Riskier: Success depends on market timing and decision-making, which can be extremely unpredictable.

Example: Building your own Stock Portfolio
Some people actively do the research on which stocks to buy. They aim to outpace the market and have an average higher return, based on the knowledge that they have on the stocks they buy.

## 3. Basics on what a Stock Price Means

Which company has higher value?

* Seabord Corporation (Represented by ticker: _SEB_) whose price per share is 2610$ (26/11/2024)
* Apple Corporation (Represented by ticker: _APPL_) whose price per share is 234$ (26/11/2024)

In reality, Apple is the most valuable company of the two (with a valuation of almost 3 trillion). Individual share prices mean absolutely nothing, because you need to know how many shares a company has. 

* Seabord corporation has 1.170.000. shares.
* Apple corporation has 15.120.000.000 shares.

Apple's single share price is worth less than Seaboard but that doesn't mean that it's less valuable than the latter. It doesn't mean that it's cheaper in absolute terms (valuation) or that it's cheaper in relative terms (to the market).

The stock price of a company reflects all available information in the market about that company. It typically means that you are paying a price for the future earnings of a company - investing in individual stocks will only make sense if you believe that **you have more information** about a company than the entire market. In that case, you believe that the market is wrong about the future earnings of the company.

## 4. Which type of investment is Better for You?

Choosing between passive and active investing depends on several factors:

#### Time and Expertise:

* If you have limited time or knowledge, passive investing is a more straightforward, less risky choice.
* If you enjoy researching stocks and understanding financial markets, active investing may be an interesting route for you to explore.


#### Risk Tolerance:

* Passive investing provides steadier, long-term returns.
* Active investing can offer higher returns but comes with a much larger risk and volatility. For example, 64% of professional fund managers underperform the market on the long term.


#### Cost Sensitivity:

* Passive investing is better for those seeking to minimize fees and maximize compounding.
* Active investing often incurs additional costs, which can reduce returns over time.


## 5. Performance Over Time: Active vs. Passive Funds
Historically, most actively managed funds underperform passive index funds. Studies have shown that over a 15-year period:

* Only about 15% of active funds outperform their benchmark index.
* Fees and human error are key reasons why active investing can struggle to beat passive investing.

## 6. Hybrid Approach: Combining Both

You don’t have to choose one or the other. Many investors use a hybrid approach. For example:

* Core Portfolio: Invest the bulk of your money passively in ETFs or index funds for steady growth.
* Satellite Portfolio: Actively invest a smaller portion in specific stocks, sectors, or funds where you have high confidence.

### Assignment 3
This week’s assignment is designed to help you decide which investing style suits you best. By the end of the assignment, you should:

* Analyze Your Personality and Goals: Reflect on your time availability, financial knowledge, and risk tolerance.
* Are you more hands-off or do you enjoy analyzing data and trends?
* Pick a Stock or Sector: Identify a company or sector you believe will perform well and research its growth potential. Example: Tech companies like NVIDIA or a clean energy company. Check their revenue, understand how they make money and check methods like Discounted Cash Flow for valuation. Choose 5 or 6 companies to invest and use Portfolio Visualizer or another tool to compare your choices vs. the market.
* Buy a portion of an individual stock (optional): If you really like a certain company and think that the market is downplaying what that company can achieve, buy a portion of the stock (40 or 50€, can be fractional) on Revolut investing. We are recommeding Revolut because you can buy fractional shares in there.
